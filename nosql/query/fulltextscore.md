### Full text score with ORDER BY RANK

```

### Full text score with WHERE and ORDER BY RANK

In this example, the `FULLTEXTSCORE` function is used in the `ORDER BY RANK` clause, and `FULLTEXTCONTAINS` is used in the `WHERE` clause.

```nosql
SELECT TOP 10 c.text
FROM c
WHERE FULLTEXTCONTAINS(c.text, "keyword1")
ORDER BY RANK FULLTEXTSCORE(c.text, "keyword1", "keyword2")
```

```json
-- Example result not available (result not provided in markdown)
```

## Remarks

- This function requires enrollment in the Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL Full Text Search feature.
- This function requires a Full Text Index.
- This function can only be used in an `ORDER BY RANK` clause, or as an argument in an `RRF` system function.
- This function canâ€™t be part of a projection (for example, `SELECT FullTextScore(c.text, "keyword") AS Score FROM c` is invalid).
