Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representation of numbers.

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [**`$bitAnd`**]($bitand.md) | The $bitAnd operator performs a bitwise AND operation on integer values and returns the result as an integer. |
| [**`$bitNot`**]($bitnot.md) | The $bitNot operator performs a bitwise NOT operation on integer values and returns the result as an integer. |
| [**`$bitOr`**]($bitor.md) | The $bitOr operator performs a bitwise OR operation on integer values and returns the result as an integer. |
| [**`$bitXor`**]($bitxor.md) | The $bitXor operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on integer values. |
