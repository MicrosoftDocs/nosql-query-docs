Set expression operators perform operations on sets and arrays treated as sets.

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [**`$allElementsTrue`**]($allelementstrue.md) | The $allElementsTrue operator returns true if all elements in an array evaluate to true. |
| [**`$anyElementTrue`**]($anyelementtrue.md) | The $anyElementTrue operator returns true if any element in an array evaluates to a value of true. |
| [**`$setDifference`**]($setdifference.md) | The $setDifference operator returns a set with elements that exist in one set but not in a second set. |
| [**`$setEquals`**]($setequals.md) | The $setEquals operator returns true if two sets have the same distinct elements. |
| [**`$setIntersection`**]($setintersection.md) | The $setIntersection operator returns the common elements that appear in all input arrays. |
| [**`$setIsSubset`**]($setissubset.md) | The $setIsSubset operator determines if one array is a subset of a second array. |
| [**`$setUnion`**]($setunion.md) | The $setUnion operator returns an array that contains all the unique elements from the input arrays. |
