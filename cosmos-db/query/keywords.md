# Keywords - Query language in Cosmos DB (in Azure and Fabric)

The query language's query language includes a set of reserved keywords that are used in queries for extended functionality.

## Keywords

Here's a list of keywords that the query language currently supports:

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[`BETWEEN`](between.md)** | The `BETWEEN` keyword evaluates to a boolean indicating whether the target value is between two specified values, inclusive. |
| **[`DISTINCT`](distinct.md)** | The `DISTINCT` keyword eliminates duplicates in the projected query results. |
| **[`LIKE`](like.md)** | The `LIKE` keyword a boolean value depending on whether a specific character string matches a specified pattern. |
| **[`IN`](like.md)** | The ``IN`` keyword checks whether a specified value matches any value in a list. |
| **[`TOP`](like.md)** | The `TOP` keyword returns the first `N` number of query results in an undefined order. |
