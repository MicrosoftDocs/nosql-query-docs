# Use LangGraph with Azure DocumentDB

Build stateful, multi-step AI agents on Azure DocumentDB with [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), the open-source agent runtime from the LangChain team. This guide shows you how to connect LangGraph to an Azure DocumentDB cluster, persist agent state through a custom checkpointer, run a thread that survives across turns, and inspect the persisted state directly in DocumentDB.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a stateful agent orchestration framework built on top of LangChain. You model an agent as a **state machine**: a graph of **nodes** (steps such as a model call, a tool call, or a database query) connected by **edges** (transitions that depend on the current state). A shared `State` object flows through the graph, and every node reads from and writes back to it.

Three properties make LangGraph well-suited to production agents:

- **Explicit, durable state.** State is checkpointed to a backing store (Azure DocumentDB, in this guide) after every step, so an agent can pause, resume, branch, or roll back to any earlier point.
- **Cycles, not just chains.** Unlike linear pipelines, LangGraph supports loops — call a tool, evaluate the result, decide to call another tool, retry, or hand off to a sub-agent.
- **Multi-agent and human-in-the-loop.** Sub-graphs compose into specialist agents that hand off to one another, and any node can pause for a human approval step.

In short, LangGraph is the runtime layer that adds memory, branching, retries, and persistence to LangChain-based agents.

## LangGraph Azure DocumentDB integration

Azure DocumentDB is a natural persistence layer for LangGraph for these reasons:

- **Document model fits agent state.** LangGraph state is a free-form object (messages, tool outputs, scratchpad fields) that varies between threads and over time. A document database stores that shape directly without a fixed schema.
- **MongoDB-compatible drivers.** Azure DocumentDB exposes the MongoDB wire protocol, so the official [`langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb`](https://pypi.org/project/langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb/) (Python) and [`@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb) (TypeScript) packages talk to it directly. MongoDB drivers and tools work without application-level rewrites, simplifying migration in common scenarios.
- **One store for state and retrieval.** Native vector indexing lives alongside document data, enabling RAG and similarity search without introducing a separate vector store. Agent checkpoints, tool call traces, and the knowledge base retrieved by your tools all live in the same cluster.
- **Portable across environments.** The same MongoDB-compatible interface works on the open-source DocumentDB engine and on the Azure-managed service, which simplifies development against local containers and promotion to production.

## Get started: install dependencies

Install LangGraph, a model provider, and a MongoDB-compatible driver. The connection string format is identical across both languages — copy the **Connection string** value from the Azure portal for your DocumentDB cluster, append `retrywrites=false`, and store it as `DOCUMENTDB_URI`.

### [Python](#tab/python)

```bash
pip install langgraph langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb langchain-core pymongo
pip install langchain-openai  # any LangChain-supported model provider
```

### [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```bash
npm install mongodb @langchain/langgraph @langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb @langchain/core
npm install @langchain/openai  # any LangChain-supported model provider
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure DocumentDB connection string requires `retrywrites=false`. The full URI shape is `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.documents.azure.com/?tls=true&retrywrites=false`. Use the same value in both languages.

## Connect LangGraph to Azure DocumentDB

The following sample connects to your cluster, configures the official MongoDB checkpointer (`MongoDBSaver`) against a dedicated database, and compiles a minimal `StateGraph` that appends each user message to a running list. The compiled graph uses the checkpointer for persistence on every step.

### [Python](#tab/python)

```python
import os
from typing import Annotated, TypedDict

from pymongo import MongoClient
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage, HumanMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.checkpoint.mongodb import MongoDBSaver
from langgraph.graph import START, END, StateGraph
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages


class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]


client = MongoClient(os.environ["DOCUMENTDB_URI"], retryWrites=False)
checkpointer = MongoDBSaver(client, db_name="langgraph_state")

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


def respond(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    reply = llm.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [reply]}


builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
builder.add_node("respond", respond)
builder.add_edge(START, "respond")
builder.add_edge("respond", END)

graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

### [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { HumanMessage, type BaseMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { MongoDBSaver } from "@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb";
import { Annotation, StateGraph, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const AgentState = Annotation.Root({
  messages: Annotation<BaseMessage[]>({
    reducer: (prev, next) => prev.concat(next),
    default: () => [],
  }),
});

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.DOCUMENTDB_URI!, { retryWrites: false });
await client.connect();

const checkpointer = new MongoDBSaver({ client, dbName: "langgraph_state" });

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o-mini" });

async function respond(state: typeof AgentState.State) {
  const reply = await llm.invoke(state.messages);
  return { messages: [reply] };
}

const graph = new StateGraph(AgentState)
  .addNode("respond", respond)
  .addEdge(START, "respond")
  .addEdge("respond", END)
  .compile({ checkpointer });
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> The Python checkpointer accepts a synchronous `MongoClient`. The TypeScript checkpointer expects an `await client.connect()`-ed `MongoClient` and runs every operation asynchronously. Reuse a single client per process in both languages.

## Run the agent

A `thread_id` ties multiple invocations to the same conversation. Send a message, then send a follow-up against the same `thread_id`; the second call resumes from the persisted state.

### [Python](#tab/python)

```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "demo-thread-1"}}

# Turn 1
result = graph.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Remember the city Seattle.")]},
    config=config,
)
print(result["messages"][-1].content)

# Turn 2 — resumes the same thread
result = graph.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="What city did I just mention?")]},
    config=config,
)
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

### [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
const config = { configurable: { thread_id: "demo-thread-1" } };

// Turn 1
let result = await graph.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("Remember the city Seattle.")] },
  config,
);
console.log(result.messages.at(-1)?.content);

// Turn 2 — resumes the same thread
result = await graph.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("What city did I just mention?")] },
  config,
);
console.log(result.messages.at(-1)?.content);

await client.close();
```

---

State persists across process restarts. Stop the program after turn 1, restart it, and the second invocation against `demo-thread-1` still has access to the prior message.

## Persist LangGraph state in DocumentDB: view checkpoints

The MongoDB checkpointer writes one document per step into a `checkpoints` collection (and accompanying writes into `checkpoint_writes`) inside the database name you configured. You can query that collection directly with any MongoDB-compatible client to inspect or audit agent runs.

### [Python](#tab/python)

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient(os.environ["DOCUMENTDB_URI"], retryWrites=False)
checkpoints = client["langgraph_state"]["checkpoints"]

for doc in checkpoints.find(
    {"thread_id": "demo-thread-1"},
    sort=[("checkpoint_id", -1)],
    limit=3,
):
    print(doc["checkpoint_id"], doc["type"])
```

### [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.DOCUMENTDB_URI!, { retryWrites: false });
await client.connect();

const checkpoints = client.db("langgraph_state").collection("checkpoints");

const recent = await checkpoints
  .find({ thread_id: "demo-thread-1" })
  .sort({ checkpoint_id: -1 })
  .limit(3)
  .toArray();

for (const doc of recent) {
  console.log(doc.checkpoint_id, doc.type);
}

await client.close();
```

A persisted checkpoint document looks like the following. The exact field set depends on the checkpointer version, but you can rely on `thread_id`, `checkpoint_id`, and a serialized `checkpoint` payload that captures the state snapshot.

```json
{
  "_id": "65f0a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0",
  "thread_id": "demo-thread-1",
  "checkpoint_ns": "",
  "checkpoint_id": "1ef5c8b1-2d34-6e78-8000-abc123def456",
  "parent_checkpoint_id": "1ef5c8b1-2d34-6e78-7fff-abc123def455",
  "type": "msgpack",
  "checkpoint": "<binary serialized state>",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "loop",
    "step": 1,
    "writes": { "respond": { "messages": ["..."] } }
  }
}
```
