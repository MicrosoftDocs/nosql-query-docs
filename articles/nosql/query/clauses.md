# NoSQL query language clauses

Queries built in the NoSQL query language are constructed of various supported clauses that are built-in to the query language.

## Clauses

Here's a list of clauses that are currently supported by the NoSQL query language.

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[`FROM`](from.md)** | The `FROM` clause identifies the source of data for a query. |
| **[`ORDER-BY-RANK`](order-by-rank.md)** | The `ORDER BY RANK` clause returns the sorted result set of a query based on the rank of scoring functions. |
